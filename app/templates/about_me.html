            <h3>Hi,</h3>
            <h1>I’m Bartek</h1>
            <br>
            <p>I've been fascinated with coding ever since I was coordinating in my former employer (job agency – CBA Fagformidling AS) developing and implementation of the process managing accommodation and tool flow. In the cooperation with the software developer we had created and developed the internal platform helping to manage mentioned process. Personally, I was responsible for: identification of my employer needs, determining the functional elements / appearance of the tool as well as for manual testing – therefore I passed an ISTQB Certificate (Nr. 28947 at 27/07/2015). </p>
            <p>Before the above, I had been learning C++, but then I switched to Python (cause it has more creative potential for me). For the last few years, my passion for discovering the new areas in programming (especially in Python) has not diminished and I have targeted my professional life for becoming a software developer.</p>
            <p><strong>Currently, after about 2 years of intensive learning I'm looking for a software developer opportunity in Python that will allow me to work alongside an expert team of developers and strengthen my knowledge and it further developed.</strong></p>
            <p>In the tab “Projects” / “GitHub” you will find my projects and software tools used for their developing.</p>
            <p>Involving me in your IT team, you gain a highly motivated, responsible and hardworking member of your community. Being work for different jobs helped me to adopt changes quickly and made me responsible, open-minded team worker. I have also ability to think through a problem and I am able to work well under pressure and adhere to strict deadlines.</p>
            <p>In terms of non-computer matters, I speak Polish, English and Norwegian (at the advance / intermediate level). I was born and grew up in Poland but then later moved to Norway (Oslo) – about 9 years ago.</p>
            <p>My broad experience in banks, job matching and running my own businesses gave me a good identification and understandings of customers’ needs I am able to work well both in a team as well as using own initiative.</p>
            <p>Thanks for visiting my website and if you would like to contact with me visit my contact page.</p>
