            <h1>Hi,</h1>
            <h3>I am Bartek Kobylinski and I'm looking job/intern as Python Developer</h3>
            <p>During my wide job experience or even a school time I found that I always met tasks which could be optimize or done better way and sometimes I had to find solutions from scratch. 
                That was plenty various tasks i.e. how to find customers where economical crisis in Europe begun for a factoring company where I used to work, how to create, manage and get certification to start making courses in a scaffold building for worker in job agency where I used to work, how to in a clean and proper way manage employee accommodation and tools used by them (this employee was around 1000 persons)… and here my journey with coding started. 
                During my job in CBA Fagformidling AS i had to optimize this flow. In cooperation with a software developer I design and implement an intern system to coordinate process to manage accommodation and equipment flow. I had been responsible for design and manual testing of it. To be able to make test I have passed an ISTQB Certificate (Nr. 28947 at 27/07/2015). I started to learn C++ but since application was build in Python i switch to that. Further and further I discovered my new passion. I started finding places where I could use my new skills and give them try. 
            <p>My big love is sailing and I want to sail alone from Oslo to Swinoujscie (a polish harbor closest to Norway but still distance is almost 900 nautical miles) so I make a script to scrape information about condition on the sea to make the best preparation to that trip. I have “discover” Raspberry Pi or Arduino so my future ‘sail’ project for sure will be one based on it (I think about full wheater station or maybe AIS device)</p> 
            <p>I’m fan of sky watching and cosmos is my the very first love and also I find the way with coding to be a bit closer to that – a specialy Mars :) - i’m getting info from there…. daily ;) I made more projects which you can check on my projects page.</p>
            <p>I’m focusing to sharpen my skills in Python, Django, Flask also I want to develop more in Java Script language. I’m using in my project  HTML, CSS even if it’s not necessary the same with database like MySQL or Postgress. Of course i’m using Git to store my repositories and I want to learn more about Docker. As I mentioned above I want to make some practical projects with Raspberry Pi based on Python. Basicly I’m looking always area where I can use my skills and grow. I’m learning fast and constant. Acttually I code almost each day not only to learn but I have really big fun with it and I know that I have opened “pandora box” which I won’t close.</p>
            <p>Thanks for visiting my website and if you would like to contact with me all contact informations are in a contact page.</p>
