            <h1>Hi,</h1>
            <h3>I am Bartek Kobylinski and I'm looking job/intern as Python Developer</h3>
            <p> My journey with coding start few years ago. During my job in CBA Fagformidling AS i wanted to optimize some process in the company. In cooperation with a software developer I design and implement an intern system to coordinate process to manage accomodation and equipment flow. I had been responsible for design and manual testing of it. To be able to make test I have passed an ISTQB Certificate (Nr. 28947 at 27/07/2015). I started to learn C++ but since application was build in Python i swith to that language. I'm passionate to it and now i try implement coding to all area of my life. I love to sail and I'm planning to sail alone from Oslo to Swinoujscie (a harbour in Poland) and to make the best preperation a made an app to crawl data from a weather bouy on see to check level of waves, wind speed, direction. For coding detail you can visit <a href="http://"><span>project site</span></a> or just go to my github site. I'm also interested in astronomy/space subjects. To feel a bit "closer" to it :) I made an app to check what weather condition are on Mars where i get daily notification on Telegram App about it. Just in case ;). I'm looking contstantly place where I can use my skills. My another small project was app to send notification by mail about new article on specific website. My current portfolio projects is available <a href="http://"><span>on project site.</span></a></p>
