            <h2>Hi,</h2>
            <h2>I’m Bartek</h2>
            
            <h2 class="my-motto" >Coding is my journey</h2>
            <p>The longest I have ever begun, and I really regret not having started this earlier, but hey it’s never too late to start something new. I’m not treating coding as a way to earn money. No! I have tried many things other than software developing but none of it was so inspiring, so fascinating, so demanding that all levels of my curiosity just bloom like a flower. I’m constantly learning better coding. I think how to code better and, yes, I’m sailing through a vast ocean of code. I will fail many times. I will make bugs, bugs and bugs again and again. That’s the life. I’m coding, and I love to do that.</p>
            <p>Thanks for being with me so long and if you would like to say Hi to me please contact me via contact page.</p>
